# StockPredictionApp

My intro to Machine Learning models using Keras Models and TensorFlow. I usedf those libraries to test and train data that I scraped off of TSX using Pandas and BeautifulSoup. I then implemented StreamLit web builder to host and design a running web app that utilizes the prediction training model to predict stock prices and trends with a 97.6% accuracy in real time. 

For this project, I developed a through understanding of machine learning through training and testing phases as well as developed a stronger
base to my web-scraping knowledge by scraping TSX data in real time. I also developed a habit of optimizing and debugging code as I went as to train and test models, I needed all the processing power I could get. 

Thanks for visiting!
